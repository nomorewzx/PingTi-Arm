# PingTi Arm - A Low-Cost Robotic Arm with Human Arm Length ü§ñüí™

## What is PingTi Arm? ü§î

**PingTi Arm** is an open-source robotic arm designed based on the [SO-100 arm](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) and is compatible with [Lerobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot). The name "PingTi" comes from the Chinese pinyin "Âπ≥Êõø" (p√≠ng t√¨), which means "affordable substitute"

## Features 
- **Human arm scale**: 600mm arm span (excluding the end effector).
- **Reasonable payload**: Supports up to 500g at maximum arm span.
- **Cost Effective**: 
  - A single PingTi arm costs ~ USD 261, 
  - A Lead-Follower setup (PingTi arm as the follower, SO-100 as the leader) costs ~ USD 390.
  - If you already own an SO-100 follower arm (12V, 30kg.cm servos), you only need 2 additional servos and a USB drive board (~$157) to assemble the PingTi arm.

## Recommendation for Beginners

- I strongly recommend you to start with [SO-100](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) and come to PingTi Arm if you are interested in:
    - a longer arm
    - reasonable payload capacity

- As stated before, if you assemble SO-100 with the `12V 30KG.cm` servos, you only need buy 2 more servos and 1 more USB control board to onboard PingTi arm. There is no waste of money

## Caution‚ö†Ô∏è
- Avoid sudden movement and stop with heavy payload (e.g. 500g)
- Risk of shoulder joint damage if these conditions are not considered.
- Consider to increase the **infill density** when print the links if you would like to frequently use with heavy payloads
