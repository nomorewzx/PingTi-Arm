## What is PingTi Arm? ðŸ¤”

**PingTi Arm** is an open-source robotic arm designed based on the [SO-ARM100 arm](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) and is compatible with [Lerobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot). The name "PingTi" comes from the Chinese pinyin "å¹³æ›¿" (pÃ­ng tÃ¬), which means "affordable substitute"

### Features 
- **Human arm scale**: 660mm arm span (excluding the end effector).
- **Reasonable payload**: Supports up to 550g at maximum arm span.
- **Low cost**: A single PingTi arm costs approximately USD 283, and a pair of Lead-Follower arms (PingTi arm as the follower and SO-ARM100 as the leader) can be assembled for USD 400.
