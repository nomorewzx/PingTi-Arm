## What is PingTi Arm? ðŸ¤”

**PingTi Arm** is an open-source robotic arm designed based on the [SO-ARM100 arm](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) and is compatible with [Lerobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot). The name "PingTi" comes from the Chinese pinyin "å¹³æ›¿" (pÃ­ng tÃ¬), which means "affordable substitute"

### Features 
- **Human arm scale**: 600mm arm span (excluding the end effector).
- **Reasonable payload**: Supports up to 500g at maximum arm span.
- **Cost Effective**: 
  - A single PingTi arm costs ~ USD 261, 
  - A Lead-Follower setup (PingTi arm as the follower, SO-ARM100 as the leader) costs ~ USD 390.
  - If you already own an SO-ARM100 follower arm (12V, 20KG.cm servos), you only need 2 additional servos and a USB drive board (~$157) to assemble the PingTi arm.
